excerpt: >-
  Segment routing is not a new concept in the networking industry and it has gained great popularity among service providers around the globe. While service providers are adopting it for the multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) data plane that is deployed extensively in existing networks, there is an increased interest to use segment routing with the IPv6 data plane for network programming (SRv6 network programming). There are many use cases that can benefit from the SRv6 network programming concept. Today, 5G is the main driver for fast-paced development of SRv6 standards to simplify the user plane and network plane. 

  With Ixiaâ€™s IxNetwork SRv6 solution, customers can simulate SRv6 networks with many nodes to validate device under test (DUT) functions in different roles (ingress node, intermediate node, and egress node) and assess the performance for both control- and data-plane...
