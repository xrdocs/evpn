technology: 'SRv6, SRMPLS'
excerpt: >-
  Segment Routing is now a well-accepted evolution path for simplifying IP/MPLS networks and for providing a solution to address the emerging requirements of 5G/IoT and service virtualization. We believe SR-MPLS and SRv6 will be increasingly deployed in service provider, enterprise, and data center networks. However, it is still early days for SRv6, and there is still a lot of work ahead to develop the vendor ecosystem and get to standardized, interoperable implementations of key features and services.
