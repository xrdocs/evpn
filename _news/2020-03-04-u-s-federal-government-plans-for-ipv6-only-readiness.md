excerpt: >-
  On 2 March 2020, the United States Federal Government released a statement about their plan to transition the majority of U.S. Government networks and services to IPv6-only networks inside the next five years. The new draft requires that "at least 80% of IP-enabled assets on federal networks are IPv6-only by the end of fiscal 2025".<br />
  In this blog, John Curran, President and CEO at ARIN, indicates that "Now is the time to begin your IPv6 planning and deployment, if you havenâ€™t already."
