excerpt: >-
  Segment Routing Traffic Engineering or SR-TE in conjunction with Automated Steering dramatically simplifies the Traffic Engineering configuration model and eliminates the RSVP soft state requirement, in favor of a Source Packet Routing model also known as SPRING.<br />
  In this blog, Mike DiVincenzo, Technical Solutions Architect MPLS/Segment Routing at WWT, decribes how Segment Routing Traffic Engineering drives scalability and network intelligence while improving capacity utilization and reducing costs.
