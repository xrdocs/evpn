excerpt: >-
  5G brings in significant changes to the mobile architecture. It relies heavily on virtualization and containerization, splits the mobile control and user plane and introduces network slicing. In the radio space new spectrum is available and the Radio Access Network infrastructure has been de-aggregated into three discrete components that can be integrated into a single unit or split across different locations.<br />
  This podcast is going to concentrate on the transport network and how segment routing can address the new requirements and changes brought in by the 5G mobile architecture.<br />
