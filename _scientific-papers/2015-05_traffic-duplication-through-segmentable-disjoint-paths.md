excerpt: >-
  Ultra-low latency is a key component of safety-critical operations such as
  robot-assisted remote surgery or financial applications where every single
  millisecond counts. In this paper, we show how network operators can build
  upon the recently proposed Segment Routing architecture to provide a traffic
  duplication service to better serve the users of such demanding applications.
  We propose the first implementation of Segment Routing in the Linux kernel and
  leverage it to provide a traffic duplication service that sends packets over
  disjoint paths. Our experiments show that with such a service existing TCP
  stacks can preserve latency in the presence of packet losses. We also propose
  and evaluate an efficient algorithm that computes disjoint paths that can be
  realised by using segments. Our evaluation with real and synthetic network
  topologies shows that our proposed algorithms perform well in large networks.
