excerpt: >-
  SDN simplifies network management by relying on declarativity (high-level
  interface) and expressiveness(network flexibility). We propose a solution to
  support those features while preserving high robustness and scalability as
  needed in carrier-grade networks. Our solution is based on (i) a two-layer
  architecture separating connectivity and optimization tasks; and (ii) a
  centralized optimizer called DEFO, which translates high-level goals expressed
  almost in natural language into compliant network configurations.
