**Daniel Bernier** of Bell Canada and **Jesper Eriksson** of NoviFlow inc., presented "Leveraging SRv6 and P4 Programmable Switch Fabric at the Network Edge" at the [**MPLS WC 2022**](<https://www.uppersideconferences.com/mpls-sdn-nfv/mplswc_2022_agenda_day_1.html>), April 2022 in Paris.
Showing how SRv6 and a P4 programmable switch fabric can reduce carrier network services costs by up to 90%, footprint by 75%, and power consumption by as much as 66% and thus facilitate a cost effective migration of latency sensitive applications to the network edge. Including actual network deployment experiences.
