Since 2017, SRv6 has gained strong traction in the industry and the ecosystem has grown unabated. As of today, SRv6 has been deployed in eight public, large-scale commercial networks and is largely backed up by the open-source community. Moreover, SRv6 standardization is well on its way with two mature proposed standards: RFC 8204 and 8754.

In this webinar, we will explore the state of SRv6 (SR with IPv6 data plane) and explain how it enhances all SR MPLS capabilities – simplification, resiliency, traffic engineering. We will also touch upon why SRv6 alleviates some of the limitations faced by SR MPLS by providing IP summarization and IPv6 header’s flow-label based built-in entropy. Another interesting concept with SRv6 is network programming that allows an end-to-end solution - all the way from the server through networks to clients - and makes it a perfect solution for 5G/ultra-scale networks.

Please join representatives from LightReading, Cisco and Bell Canada as we discuss:

* SRv6 network programming
* SRv6 use cases
* SRv6 standardization

**Speakers:**

* **Sterling Perrin**, Principal Analyst – Optical Networking & Transport, Heavy Reading
* **Daniel Bernier**, Senior Technical Architect, Bell Canada
* **Clarence Filsfils**, Cisco Systems Fellow, Cisco
