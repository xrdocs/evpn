**Excerpt**: Interaction between applications and network infrastructure is increasingly important to service providers and enterprises. Greater interaction will help service providers optimize their network infrastructure, and more importantly, offer new services that can generate incremental revenues. The CiscoÂ® Application Engineered Routing solution can raise this interaction to a previously unachievable level. This simple and scalable architecture uses customer network assets and augments them with network programmability capabilities that allow applications to program the network, delivering end-to-end, per-flow policy from the data center through the WAN to end users.
