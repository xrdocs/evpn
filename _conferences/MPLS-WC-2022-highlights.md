The [**MPLS WC 2022**](<https://www.uppersideconferences.com/mpls-sdn-nfv/mplswc_2022_agenda_day_1.html>) Conference, April 2022 in Paris, paid particular attention to SRv6: Technical Progress, Interop, and next steps. Moreover, an impressive set of service providers describe current deployments and introduce some exciting innovations.

This page highlights a selection of SRv6 topics presented at this conference, and several demos and innovations that have been announced at that time.

<br />

### Demonstrations:
<br />
#### [SRv6 ultra-scale - Imposition of 26 SRv6 uSIDs at Linerate](/demos/26-usid-push-linerate)
An NCS 5700 acting as an SRv6 PE pushes 26 uSIDs at linerate.

<br />
#### [SRv6 Stateless slicing at Ultra-Scale](/demos/stateless-slicing)
